# Safecoin SDK

Use the Safecoin SDK Crate to write client side applications in Rust.  If writing on-chain programs, use the [Safecoin Program Crate](https://crates.io/crates/safecoin-program) instead.

More information about Safecoin is available in the [Safecoin documentation](https://docs.solana.com/).

The [Safecoin Program Library](https://github.com/fair-exchange/safecoin-program-library) provides examples of how to use this crate.
