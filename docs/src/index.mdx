# Safecoin Documentaion

Safecoin is a blockchain built for mass adoption. It's a high performance network that is utilized for
a range of use cases, including finance, NFTs, payments, and gaming. Safecoin operates as a single
global state machine, and is open, interoperable and decentralized.

## Getting started

Dive right into Safecoin to start building or setup your tooling.

- [Setup local environment](/cli) - Install the Safecoin CLI to get your local development environment setup
- [Hello World in your browser](getstarted/hello-world) - Build and deploy your first on-chain Safecoin program,
  directly in your browser using Safecoin Playground

## Start learning

Build a strong understanding of the core concepts that make Safecoin different from other blockchains.

- [Transactions](./developing/programming-model/transactions) - Collection of instructions for the blockchain to execute
- [Accounts](./developing/programming-model/accounts) - Data and state storage mechanism for Safecoin
- [Programs](./developing/intro/programs) - The executable code used to perform actions on the blockchain
- [Cross-Program Invocation](./developing/programming-model/calling-between-programs) - Core of the "composability"
  of Safecoin, this is how programs can "call" each other.

## Understanding the architecture

Get to know the underlying architecture of how the proof-of-stake blockchain works.

- [Validators](./validator/anatomy) - the individual nodes that are the backbone of the network
- [Clusters](./cluster/overview) - a collection of validators that work together for consensus

## Running a validator

Explore what it takes to operate a Safecoin validator and help secure the network.

- [System requirements](./running-validator/validator-reqs) - Recommended hardware requirements and expected SAFE
  needed to operate a validator
- [Quick start guide](./running-validator/validator-start) - Setup a validator and get connected to a cluster
  for the first time
